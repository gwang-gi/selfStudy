# selfStudy
    This is repository for what I've learnt during University.
    It only contains what I studied again after Semester during holiday OR after Semester.
    This may be used for porfolio for proving what I was thinking, what I applied in terms of Computer Science Courses.

## Remember
    Nothing is impossible, impossible is the term people who gave up easily without intensive efforts.
    I am not pure Computer Science Student (itmb), but I felt I could do better than normal CS student as I was better than the normal.
